GraduationProject-GreenIT

This project was made in collaboration with Egod Haifa ( איגוד הערים מפרץ חיפה)
The initial request was to make a monitoring system for sustainability metrics in schools,
After user research we found out it was much deeper and more complex than the intial request.
Our solution was building an online community for sustainable schools and green orgnizations, allowing sharing knowledge and resources and ultimatly promoting sustainability.
